<h1>tarkov-stash</h1>
<div>This mod for <a href="https://hub.sp-tarkov.com">SPT</a> allows you to edit your stash visually. Can't find those USB drives? I got you. You have some item that is not found in raid? Say no more!</div>
<h2>Main features</h2>
<h3>Stash explorer</h3>
See all your items in your stash, open any backpack or weapon and see its stats:
<div class="video">
  <video width="800" autoplay>
    <source src="v1.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    Your browser does not support the video tag.
  </video>
  <em>This video content might be outdated</em>
</div>
<h3>Add items</h3>
This allows you to add any item of the game, for weapons and armors please use <em>Add preset</em> button.
<h3>Add presets</h3>
This is the recommended way to add weapons and armors since it includes all the required attachments to work.
<h3>Set item to FiR</h3>
A simple toggle to mark items FiR.
<h3>Restore durability</h3>
Kind of useless but if you have few medkits half used you can always restore them to max instead of deleting and adding them again. You can also repair your armors.
<h3>Delete items</h3>
If you added the wrong item, this might help you :-)
<h2>Installation</h2>
The mod comes in zip format, just double click it and drag and drop the content of it in your SPT folder. If you had installed a previous version make sure you go to your <em>SPT/user/mods</em> folder and delete the previous one.
<h2>Download</h2>
