## Tarkov stash

Simple stash editor with a simple UI. If you need more advanced features I recommend to use [SPT-API Profile editor](https://hub.sp-tarkov.com/files/file/184-spt-aki-profile-editor/)

This is based out of another project of mine: [task-stash-console](https://github.com/angel-git/tarkov-stash-console):

> Some versions are not compatible, please check the terminal logs to see warnings

### Requirements

It is recommended to run this with [Windows terminal](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/windows-terminal/9N0DX20HK701) and not the default command prompt, it supports emojis :-)

### Features

- Set *found in raid* to items
- Increase currencies

### Demo

### Download
