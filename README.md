## Tarkov stash

Simple stash editor with a simple UI. If you need more advanced features I recommend to use [SPT-API Profile editor](https://hub.sp-tarkov.com/files/file/184-spt-aki-profile-editor/)

This is based out of another project of mine: [task-stash-console](https://github.com/angel-git/tarkov-stash-console):
